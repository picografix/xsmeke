<h2 class="main-intro">Please ignore the spelling and grammar mistakes which I frequently make during this blog.
  That's because I update this blog daily late night, half asleep, at around 4 AM. Thanks for understanding.

    <p class="blog-content">

      Life is a bit boring these days. Missing all my friends from college. People have started following funny trends out of boredom, few of which 
      include posting photos from childhood days, making potato, tomato and what not in insta stories, tagging creators and loads of stories like 
      comment first letter of your name and so on. I have to design nss magazine and inquirer but I'm not in the mood to open adobe creative suit. It has 
      bored me ab to be honest. Also, I am trying to shift my website to a new automated database. WIll take a lot of efforts, but will be worth it. Hence, 
      created a survey for that, sent it to a few people whom I know that they read my blog, if you do it too anonymously, please visit https://forms.gle/WRk9urUD6JpArUst8 and fill the 
      survey, will be of much help, because the number of responses I'll be getting are very low, around 10 I am assuming. PM Modi has announced that Sunday 
      will be a "janta-curfew" day for everyone. I am also planning to edit our Valley of Flowers, aftermovie. I am short of clips, but I'll try if I get time.

      Found out old animation projects on my laptop and have decided to post them on instagram, 2 posts per week. First post gathered 
      1500 hashtags reach, and the second one 9 lol. I don't know why. Every other hostel in insti started making "hostel_pfc" page 
      today. And started accusing me for those pages. Around 500 mb of my daily data is still remaining, so I'm downloading random 
      youtube standup videos to squish it. Ordered a trimmer today. I don't know how but all the layers from page 2 of my article from 
      inquirer automatically vanished and instead a black solid colour layer appeared. I will have to redesign it i guess. Kafi time waste. 
      CBSE Exams and Mains too, got postponed due to Corona outbreak. I don't know how will everything be managed after it gets normal. But it sure 
      will be great to look back at 2020 and it's consequences.

      Designed a bit of inquirer and NSS Magazine today. Photoshop kept on crashing the whole day. Will have to fix it soon.
      Did nothing else today. Not that bored at home as I was expecting.

      The train was exactly on time. Papa came to receive me, we then took our car to home. Roads are as such, no development. And 
      also the traffic jams in the city. Our home is been painted so nothing was in place. But my room was arranged. Did a format 
      factory reset to my laptop. No space was available in the C drive and Illustrator was crashing often. And now I don't remember 
      the undervolt settings I had applied to keep the temperature in check. It shoots 85' C randomly. Will browse it tomorrow, because 
      data pack for today is squished :(. Finally merged the assignment 1 with the master repository this evening. Am planning to watch a 
      movie before I go to sleep.

      I had to catch my train this evening. All the day went in packing and listening to music on speakers hi. Our two design credits 
      got approved. Adarsh sir had brought poha for us this morning. Kafi accha breakfast. Caught the train. Suryansh had brought very
      tasty dinner from his home. Then we saw article 15 in the train, and now I'm going to sleep. The train is on time abhi tak to and 
      will probably drop us at 9:55 AM tomorrow morning.

      Helped Santosh Sir in his website. Got a treat at Masala Mix in return. There was a hailstorm this afternoon. I, meanwhile, 
      am trying to shift my blog to a better database blog. This is too simple and too long. I have made a blog using mysql and django
      but the problem is it's hosted on https://xsmeke.pythonanywhere.com/ you can visit it abhi obviously. The domain name is too long and 
      not nice. I will have to figure a way to host this on github itself. Also i have to migrate loads of data to this new database. 
      This new blog is clean and simple. It's been almost 2 months, and almost everyday's record is here on my blog. I started coding this 
      new blog at 4 pm approximately and it was ready by 9:30 pm. Had too many bugs, took a lot of time. Will take another stretch of 
      4-5 hours, and I will have a new blog. Meanwhile, Harsh's body temperature shot up to 106'F, according to his thermometer. He is 
      sure that he has corona, and was going to RML hospital for checkup lol. Copied all the movies from his laptop to my phone and now 
      I'm going to sleep. Also we cleaned the room this evening. Kafi productive day overall.

      First day of the vacations. Woke up late (obviously), played GTA 5 all day, made a penguin on Illustrator. Didn't turn out well.
      Booked my tickets for home. Dean has ordered to vacate the hostel by Sunday midnight. Got very creative responses for my insta 
      question sticker. Most common response was Guilty and Money Heist. Went to Rajendra Dhaba with Harsh and Chand for dinner. 
      Wasn't worth the hype. We had to sit on floors and eat. We then went to a nearby sweets store and tasted all sorts of sweets 
      available. Everyone in the wing was planning and were very enthusiastic that night, plans of Murthal, base plaza, Spiti Valley 
      were made. I obviously preferred my bed over all these plans. Chand gave me company. We started watching Dabangg 3 lol and ended 
      up watching random stand up comedy videos on Amazon prime.

      You wouldn't fucking believe what happened today.
      <br>
      Let me start from the beginning. Had classes from 8 AM, had a surprising surprise quiz at 9 AM, in which the 
      professor gave us 2 mins in between to discuss the answers lol. Had no classes after that. So I came and slept.
      But but but, in between, a message came from Hetvi to the BSP group about corona's outcomes and measures and people 
      started discussing too many things. In between, Delhi's government announced to shut down all the classes and 
      schools till 31st March. But but but, we are IIT Delhi. We are an autonomous and we are also the studious univ, so 
      we don't close the univ due to a virus outbreak. Meanwhile, an image floated on whatsapp displaying a guy standing beside
      an ambulance wearing a very cool suit like the ones they wore at Chernobyl at Zanskar Hostel. And people started spreading 
      rumours that the house secy, who just came from Norway, has been diagnosed with Corona Virus. and boii, people 
      started spamming every possible group with rumours. Also Pulkit Kejriwal, son of Arvind Kejriwal, messaged on 
      some group that no classes will run till 31st. I was telling everyone that classes will not happen and minors will 
      get postponed, but not a single soul heard me. So I headed towards CSC to study for the minors. I also had to make 
      a lab report, which would atleast take 4-5 hours. Our director then mailed us that academics will continue and 
      attached few safety guidelines. I was disappointed, decided not to touch my phone for 2 hours and started studying with 
      my earphones lol. Suddenly everyone started shouting and people started getting out of the CSC. I unplugged my earphones 
      and checked my phone just to find out that Director had again mailed with a subject <b>Suspension of classes at IIT Delhi until March 31, 2020</b>
      . And boi, people freaked out. they emptied csc within minutes, started shouting "Jai Corona, Jai Corona" in hostels. 
      I was in tears. I was not this happy when I cleared JEE Advanced. The impossible has happened. I still can't believe.
      IIT Delhi is closed till 31st. We are free. No more, "We'll ride at dawn bitches". We've won, Mr. Stark. Few extra 
      careful and maggu people were also worried that the second mail, came from a different mail id, and that they'll scrap our 
      weekends. But I'm happy. I did not go to my home this mid sem break. I cannot describe our feelings in words. No one can't. 
      People are dancing with joy. Few people just arrived after enjoying their break lol. This blog will never finish if I keep on 
      describing Everything. Also, both the profs were very happy, with my script and with the project report. Just to sum up
      one of the best days of my life yet.

      Woke up at 11 AM, ate lunch, again slept till 4 PM. Have slept a total of 29 hours in past 36 hours. Personal 
      second best. Harsh's still high. He called and asked for CML100 notes. We are in 4th sem abhi and took the CML1OO 
      course in our second semester. I took him to library so that we can study something for the minors. But he did nothing 
      and sent him back hostel, tracing his live location, because he was still high. I did complete my project's first 
      assignment and that is why missed Chirag's birthday celebrations. Sorry Chirag :( and Happy Birthday. Today was the
      last day of the mid sem break. I haven't still submitted my DSL ka assignment, whose deadline was on 5th March.
      Going to sleep early tonight, at 4 AM, have a class at 8 AM.

      Happy Holi guys!! The best holi I've ever had. Slept almost the entire day. Woke up at 4 pm when all the 
      colors of harsh were over lol.  Not a single particle of color has touched me yet, except the very enthusiastic
      color sneak harsh put on us, at the very midnight hour. Ordered 5 tawa roti at rajdhani because subah se kuch 
      khaya nhi tha. He forgot my order, and gave 5 tandoori rotis instead. So, now I am high on tandooris lol. 
      My belly is almost about to explode. Talking about being high, Lochan, Harsh, Manish and Chirag had heavy doses
      of Bhang today at Girnar hostel and I don't know what all they are doing after that. Chirag danced 40 minutes 
      in his room, assuming that everybody was dancing with him, while everyone is at their homes lol. Lochan slept in 
      his bathroom. Harsh is talking random shit, doing random actions, and messaging everyone random things. I am 
      sleeping in Lochan's room tonight, because Sagar sir is sleeping in my room. Only one more day of mid sem break 
      is left, I don't know itna jldi kaise khtm ho gya, :( .

<h2 class="blog-heading">9th March, Monday </h2>
    <p class="blog-content">
     
      Nothing much happened today, our new professor called us to meet regarding our new project. The project is 
      very exciting and also confidential, so lol, can't share the details in my blog. When professor asked me about 
      my programming experience, I forgot to mention my two best projects, this website and the winter intern, and 
      instead told him about my incomplete disa project. Nevertheless, we joined the research group, and summers sorted. 
      We then bought new stationary out of excitement, which I'm quite sure will not be used ever. We have Holi 
      tomorrow, and people have started celebrating from today itself. I don't know why these fests come. Instead of
      these useless religious fests, we should have a long weekend every week. Please don't start hate commenting on 
      my DMs about this, but still, why should I celebrate holi tomorrow. Amidst two projects, 3 assignments, millions
      of club and design projects and an approaching minor exam and many more hidden suprise quizzes, why should I 
      celebrate and color the faces and walls of the campus without any reason. Just because few people from the past
      have started doing it. I will try to hide somewhere in the campus, or harsh will forcibly take me to the holi 
      celebrations in the campus. Good news is, we don't have a water pool coming in our hostels this time. And the 
      bad news is Harsh have bought millions of packets of colors, and balloons to celebrate holi full power tomorrow. 
      He has even started filling the balloons with water abhi se hi. Meanwhile we completed the Winter project report 
      and mailed it to our professor, with a happy holi message. What a beautiful report I've made. I am proud of it's 
      design.

      Had PFC Photoshoot today. Got plenty of spam material and new dp to update on facebook, finally, after an year.
      Thanks to Santosh sir * watery eyes emoji * for this cool initiative. I don't know how to pose for sure. Whereas
      Kunal sir is god of poses. Did my first lightroom edit today for my new profile picture. Turns out I'm good at it :p
      Lochan installed tinder today, got 7 likes in 20 minutes and uninstalled it then lol. Am currently listening

      Slept the entire day. Santosh Sir has planned for a photoshoot tomorrow morning for my profile picture lol. 
      Let's see if I get one. Harsh, Lochan and I were playing games based on bollywood songs tonight, like guess
      the song using english lyrics, using emojis, by listening 3 seconds of it. Not very proud to say, but we are 
      pro at it. Was the first day of a very long weekend today. Did not go home this time. Will study for minors and 
      for the new project, hopefully.

      Got a new project under my fav. prof and in my favourite field today. Helped Saksham in his assignment. 
      Started the weekend by completing half my winter project report. Hopefully that will give us two design 
      credits. 3/5 done then. Haven't slept since last 34 hours, but I am also not feeling sleepy idk why.
      Also today, something strange happened. I locked my room, kept the keys above the door, because my room mate
      never keeps his keys with him. I went for lab then, came after an hour. The room was wide open. Harsh didn't come
      in between. Everything was intact except one thing. The strap of my left slipper was broken. So, someone invaded
      my room just to break my slipper. Who has itna problem mere chalne se????

      Found a fantastic professor today. Very few people know that I dream of working at Google Maps someday.
      I have also made my version of maps based on python. Not too good, but works fine. So, that professor is
      doing research on similar field. I've mailed him today, let's see how it goes. Had a surprise quiz today.
      Wasn't too surprised waise to after listening this. Our prof announces about the surprise quiz everytime 
      a class before the quiz. Me and Saksham got wet poorly in the rain after our DSL class. The rain was very light
      when we left the design department, but got heavy when we reached Bharti. I was in slippers, I couldn't run. 
      One more day of academics and then a long long weekend ahead. Also han, Folks, keep washing your hands, and stay safe from corona :)

      fine two days ago and look now. Congratulations Corona. People were spreading rumours that someone 
      from Himadri got infected by Corona, aka COVID 19. It was fake news most probably. The only good

      WTF! WTFFFF!! WE LOST. What the hell is happening with my life. Nothing is going well. We lost.
      Kumaon unexpectedly came first. We tied with Zanskar lol. We would be at position 4 if the penalty
      is counted lol. 12 hours of editing and we are 4. I am going to watch editing tutorials ab to on 
      youtube. Very Very disappointing. My life is disappointing ab to since past few days. Intern got 
      postponed, date got cancelled, lost in music video, chelsea is losing all the matches. I don't 
      know what I should do in my life. I thought atleast I've sorted out 2nd year interns but lol, nhi.
      I'll have to start from scratch again. I don't know whether I should go for civil ya tech ya consult
      ya analytics ya design in my life. Someone please guide me seriously. Anyways, I'll sleep ab, and try
      mailing in mid sem break. I am sick of all these BTs ab to :(((.

     Kafi sad day. It's 8:10 AM, Tuesday and I am updating Monday's blog in CVL's class. Haven't slept
     since past 24 hours. This afternoon, I got a mail from Japan that I will facing difficulties in 
     getting the VISA for Japan due to Corona Virus. Also they are now cancelling their meetings 
     because of the Corona virus outbreak. So, my prof. advised me to postpone my intern to December
     and I agreed. So I am berozgaar for summers abhi to. I might try for another foreign intern or
     can end up doing a corporate intern. idk. Edited the music video. from 8-7. 11 hours of editing.
     But the outcome was worth it. We are taking a slight risk by extending the time limit to 5:30 for 
     which we'll face -5 marks penalty. But that won't affect the rank supposedly because the video is 
     kafi nice at the end. The end could've been better but chill hai abhi ke liye. Well done team ♥
     We'll lift the trophy tonight, because I've already seen Zanskar's video, I, honestly, did not understand
     what was happening. Suicides, Suicides and Suicides. The start was super lit, I was awstruck. But the
     end was not so good. Very confusing tbh. So most probably we'll win. And we should win too, I haven't 
     slept since past 23-24 hours. Will do two more classes and then sleep and then go to lab.

     Woke up again at 1 pm. I have slept around 25 hours in past two days. OnAir managers cancelled the Party
     because few people were not attending it. It's now postponed to 18th March. Most probably it won't happen
     ever, just like Tryst and RDV party. I had cancelled my date for this, but I also had a backup date planned
     pahle se, about which I am obviously not gonna write in my blog. Sorry Saksham, you'll never know what 
     happened! The mess feast was disappointing. Like, very disappointing. Uphoria ended today, for all those
     who don't know, Uphoria is our hostel fest. It was also disappointing. We completed shooting our music
     video tonight. Will probably do a marathon edit tomorrow. 12 pm is the deadline i suppose and I have 
     classes till 8 pm. :(

     of my iPad was perfectly fine, only the tempered glass on it was damaged. All these years I thought That
     I broke my screen. Got new screen guards and back cover for iPad and phone. Won a bet with Adarsh xD. Went 
     to do my assignment in Reading Room, but Uphoria's CS GO peeps kicked us out, then I went to ex hall. Did
     my assignment. LIVERPOOL LOST TO WATFORD TODAY !! 3-0 WO BHI !!! thank you so much watford! Chelsea's such 
     a disappointment, they were about to lose to Bournemouth tonight. Playing Asphalt 8 since 2 hours now because
     the shopkeeper said that the bubble in the screen will automatically go when you'll heat it by playing games.
     It is intact abhi tk to, I guess Apple's processors are too cool to heat up. I was about to go on a date 
     tomorrow, but they scheduled onAir party tomorrow so yaaay! I'll go to the party first. Ok bye, I again will
     sleep for 10-12 hours lol.

      The weekend starts. Had a very poor haircut from jia-sarai. 1/10 NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED. Balram was about
      to kill me for the post I made yersterday. I helped Saksham in his assignment. I don't why but the code
      I wrote yesterday for my assignment was not working properly. But somehow, I did it at the end. Varun, KP
      Lokesh and Santosh were having a meeting at the same time to decide for who should go for PFC Secy. They 
      sorted nothing at the end, but found my blog, and exported it to PDF and sent it on all the groups.
      Then Varun and KP forcibly took me for my pending birthday party. KP didn't let me choose the cafe, and 
      chose some random Prime Street Cafe at CP. We went there, the place was too dark themed and the music was
      too loud. We then went to idk, i guess, 0 degrees, that too was same. The tables were throbbing due to 
      the loud music. We then went to some other place, and there there was no main course, only waffles. We finally
      went to some other cafe. It was one of the worst cafes I have ever went. The music was too dull. Like they
      were playing "Choo kar mere man ko, kiya tune kya isharaa" literally. And the food was too bad. KP should've 
      let me choose the destination for the party. And Yash had his birthday at 29th Feb. He is now 5 years old lol.
      Priyanshi took my phone for an hour and tried to unlock it to see how many insta accounts do I use. Obviously
      she couldn't. Then we took the most depressing cab to insti in which Red FM was playing random bollywood songs,
      which were even more depressing. Overall, waste of 4 hours approx. I now am going to sleep and will wake up probably
      11 hours from now i.e tomorrow 1 PM. Since too many people read my blog now, Have a happy weekend guys :)

      Nothing much happened today. Done my DSL assignment, cleaned my room a bit. Tomorrow is one more working
      day and then much needed weekend will come. I haven't slept properly since ages. Me and Lochan made a super
      cute and a bit offensive post about Balram today on loman_cheena's instagram. The post went hit as expected.
      And Balram was offended, which was also expected lol. He called me for about 17 times to make me delete 
      the post. And we had a long convo on whatsapp, and I finally archived it after lochan said. He'll most
      probably kill me tomorrow in the class for this. Let's see what happens.
      <br> 
      Today, RDV Cordies went for Creative Team Party without inviting me :'(. Naa tshirt mili, na hoodie, na party -_-.
      Fuck RDV. 
      <br>
      Also someone made an instagram
      account named "saxy_pandey" for me lol. I AM FAMOUS NOW.Waise I pretty much know who he is.

    </p>



<h2 class="blog-heading">26th February 2020, Wednesday</h2>
            <p class="blog-content"> 

              Will be updating the blog chronologically now, like the latest one will be on top, so That
              you guys don't have to scroll down everytime you come to read this.
              <br>


               Okay, so last few days have been very very very very hectic. <b>I had no time to update the blog, so I am
                 writing the summary of past ek week here.
               </b>
               <br>
               I completed loads of designs for sportech, helped Saksham in his Microsoft assignment,
               completed Secy Showdown anyhow. 
              <br> 

               Secy Showdown was such a mess, first I messed up the audio, then they the memes, oh god! and then
               the sudden unsync and then the improper titles and then the unusual render file. I was about to
               delete all the files and sleep, it was such a mess.
               <br>

               And then Saksham's assignment, the deadline got extended twice. We made 3 complete night outs in total.
               Let's hope he gets an internship, and then I'll also try for Microsoft next year hopefully, if I take
               design, I just went one class this week abhi tak. Last Saturday was also working. Sunday kab aaya pata hi nhi
               chla. I finally came to my room tonight after ages. Chelsea lost 3-0 against Bayern yesterday.
               <br>

               I am not participating in Gazetelle because our super lit lit rep is too busy to write a few articles
               for our magazine. I cannot participate in Gazetelle since last two years because of him. He has time
               to conduct socials, drink whole night, but can't write a article for a magazine. BEST LIT REP EVER.
               Also, everyone is accusing me for Udaigiri_internals insta page, idk why. nvm though. Loman Cheena
               is a hit.
               <br>

              Submitted all the required documents for my Japan internship. Also forex results came, as expected,
              kuch bhi ho rha tha result me.
              <br>

              Also Also, I am the course topper in DSL810, like literally, I am the course topper till minor 1.
              In a class jisme Animesh Sir, Saksham Sir and i don't know who else are present, I am the class
              topper. This is the first instance after coming to IIT that I can actually share my grades with
              my family. I hope they don't read my blog. Also Katyayny messaged me on Insta tonight, she reads 
              my blog. I was in shock for a few seconds after listening this. Like I didn't know her before this 
              evening. 
              <br>
              So, one more week and then I'll be free hopefully. I sometimes want to quit designing because of
              the work load I face daily. Most of the executives under me are uncapable of producing a beautiful
              design which I can directly approve. I can't rely on them for an urgent work. I try to do all of 
              these by my own. I surely am disappointed by the Y19 batch of IIT Delhi abhi tak to. I don't know
              how will we pull off RDV next semester. I won't do RDV next sem if my summer intern went well.
              I have to study a lot for my intern and I don't have time amidst all these fests and poltu.
              Okay, so I'll try to update the blog daily again by tomorrow, I am sorry for all those who came 
              and did not find it updated. I have to complete my DSL assignment too. So Goodbye.
              <br>

      I AM BORN.
      <br>
      <br>
      I changed all my usernames to xsmekes today because I was fed up with having different combinations of Ayush
      for every site, so I thought of having a common username for every platform and that's how XSMEKE was born. Also, I added a new section for blogs today on my personal website. Not many animations, clean and simple. I will try to update this blog daily, as a part of my daily activity. Let's see how it goes. Apparently, this was one of my
      new year resolutions from 2018 lol, so here we go :)
      <br>
      <br>
      Today, apparently PFC people banned me from participating in Create 2.0. They said I was too pro for it.
      Also, I tried egg rice for the first time at Shiva Night mess, it was okayish. I started preparing for minor 1
      from today, did nothing today but coded this blog. Will start studying from tomorrow hopefully.
      Tomorrow we might have a surprise quiz in the transportation's class. Waking up late tonight because I have to complete a teaser for dance club.

    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-heading">23rd January 2020, Thursday</h2>
    <p class="blog-content">
      So yes, we had a surprise quiz today morning. I somehow gave it and surprisingly I am scoring
      8.5/10 in it. Slept total of 3 hours today. Made two beautiful pages for elemental today.
      Did not go to mess the entire day :p
      Have loads of assignments and academic work pending but will try to complete them by this weekend.

      he's very excited about it. Tried to photoshop a hen and a horse together, was unsuccessful.
      Now I'm watching Chelsea vs Hull City match, hopefully we will win today. Chelsea took my
      advice of dropping Kepa too seriously ig lol.
      Tryst's theme video got published today, Aryan and Gauransh did a pretty amazing job. That was the
      only work i was involved in, as a tryst co-ordinator, before leaving.

      Wasted all my time today while editing the Delhi Video, the outcome was fantastic. Everyone loved it.
      Since the dinner was not served in mess, had to go to jia-sarai to eat. Our gPay was not working and
      we only had 150 cash, Me and Rakla, so we got a 10 Rs discount lol, cause the bill was of 160 Rs.
      Also tried ordering food from zomato, made 3 IDs but couldn't, rakla knows why lol. Also surprisingly
      Udaigiri came first in GD, lol. Probably, I should get a party from Siddharth and Jinay, afterall I
      made the video and the poster.

      Woaah, January went so fast and we have minors from Monday. Studied a bit, ate outside because the
      mess food was too bad to survive on. Lochan gave immense confidence regarding minors, have to
      decide a project by tomorrow and also make a proposal for it. Watched all the four premier league
      matches today.

      Have HUL's paper tomorrow at 11 am. Wish me luck :)

      <h2 class="blog-heading">3rd February 2020, Monday</h2>
    <p class="blog-content">
      So I ruined my HUL's paper. I'm getting 9.5 of 20 :(
        Tomorrow, I have structure's paper, i have already prepared for this by this evening. Have also
        solved both the minor papers too. Let's see how that goes, that should go excellent i suppose.
        Also, HUL's paper was from 11 AM, all this time I thought it's from 5 PM.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-heading">4th February 2020, Tuesday</h2>
    <p class="blog-content">
      What the hell is happening, the paper came so tough, I bet the TAs also can't solve it in 1 hour.
      I also did a fantastic silly mistake which is gonna cost me atleast 5 marks now.
      I'll get good grades, if the grading is relative. Else the whole class is gonna get 6-7 i suppose.
      Tomorrow I have two papers, cvl and transportation, both are not well prepared.
      Let's see what I do tomorrow, Minors are going absolutely disgusting till now.
      <p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">5th February 2020, Wednesday</h2>
    <p class="blog-content">
      surprisingly both the papers went extremely well. Transportation's paper came so easy lol, everyone's
      gonna get above 15 in 20. Harsh got caught in CVL's exam lmao. TA awarded him -5. He then said "Sir, itna to
      hum paa nhi rhe hain, jitna aapne negative kr diya hai", lol.
      I haven't slept in ages. Tomorrow is the last exam, soil, about which i know nothing abhi tak. and Hydraulics,
      for which I'm kinda prepared, Lochan will teach the last topic in few minutes.     <p>

        <h2 class="blog-heading">6th February 2020, Thursday</h2>
    <p class="blog-content">
      Finally, Minorsss are OVEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRR. But shit, again the normal hectic boring life is back.
      Hydraulics's minor went well, and i don't know if anyone will score above 20 in soil's exam today.
      The paper was hell difficult and i also wasn't prepared for it. I slept in the biotech lawns itself
      after the exam. Then went to SDA, ate momos and a icecream. I thought I'll sleep before attending the CTM
      Meet, but suryansh came in between and now the no sleep streak continues. I took a bath today after ages.
      . Also tomorrow is Saksham's birthday. Happy Birthday Saksham, if you read my blog :p
      Me and Varun picked up someone's dominos pizza from chayoos today lol, they were kept there unattended.
      My wingies had a good time then :p
      The theme decided for create is momothon, i gave kafi creative puns today hehe.
      So I'm giving out the theme here before the competition which is illegal in one way, but I'm also
      sure that no one reads my blog. :p

      <p>

        <h2 class="blog-heading">7th February 2020, Friday</h2>
    <p class="blog-content">
      Today I completed my lab report 5 mins before 3 PM. Today was the round 1 of Create 2.0,
      few teams literally used comic sans in their designs. Few teams were too good, I am so Happy
      after looking at their designs, especially the Orion Guy, finally we have few people in our
      from first year who are familiar with Adobe Illustrator and After Effects. And Hetvi literally
      made a cool momo logo using only her phone alone. She forgot her laptop.
      Also Santosh sir made me do photography. I rarely do photography, I am much inclined towards
      design and editing. Anyways, the photos were nice, according to him :p.
      It is 4:26 AM as I am writing this and I also have to wake up early tomorrow to manage the final
      round. Life is hard :(, I haven't slept properly since last Monday. Today was Ayesha's birthday
      celebration and Garvil kicked us out of his room because we were making a lot of noise while
      judging the entries at around 3 AM. The theme decided for tomorrow is A fest related to the momo
      guy. Also we've planned a trick to write the prompt in white font on white background. Teams will
      have to first decode it and then solve.

      <p>

        <h2 class="blog-heading">8th February 2020, Saturday</h2>
        <p class="blog-content">
         So, I woke up early and went to manage Create. It got over successfully. Teams had difficulties in the
         final moments because the wifi was slow, but overall it was a huge success. We've compiled and sent
         the final entries to the professor, who will judge this event. Had two parties today. Also Rajdhani's
         manager gave us 4 plates of Paneer and Chicken Tikka's for free!! I don't know why, may be because of
         Faraz Sir. Kunal and Santosh gave PFC party today. They made me dance lol, for the first time I guess.
         I had a signature step to dance with lmao. We had fun at the party. Tomorrow is Sunday, I'll sleep the
         whole day to compensate for the lack of sleep I've had over the past few days.
         so Gooooood Niggghhhhhhtttttttttttttttttt zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

             I spent the entire day sleeping and then made the project presentation slide and the video.

             Udaigiri lost both the matches in Cricket this weekend. Tonight is the oscar ceremony.
             I'm guessing that 1917/Joker will win the best movie award.

              So parasite won the best movie award yesterday. I tried searching it on uTorrent,
              but did not get the host lol. We had project presentations today at DSL 810. It went
              well, only because my site and the video was cooler lol, TAs did not ask much questions
              after watching them. Amenreet literally named his Project, project Aaha hehe. I then had
              a sportech cordi meet. which was a complete waste of time. What they did for 1.5 hours
              was introduction of their team. I'm not gonna attend any further meeting from now
              onwards. I was then supposed to edit The SecyShowDown but lokesh did not show up
              till 1 AM and also the video quality was very poor for the Cam1. What are you doing
              Navaneeth? The ISO was kept low ig, (inserts you had one job meme) Also today I came
              to know that people do actually read my blog. Now I can not give out prompts for free
              lol. <b>Also I write this at around 4 AM daily, half asleep, so please forgive me for my

             everyone how much I get in the minors so don't expect that lol. The soil lab got over in 36
             minutes today, their personal best. Started editing Secy Show Down, my head is paining after
             syncing 5 different audios and 2 different cameras that too for a timeline of around 45 minutes.
             Will do it tomorrow. I will have to make the Sportech Trailer i guess. Also the paneer roll of
             Satpura Night mess tastes very bad, please don't buy it if you ever plan to. I am planning to leave
             all my classes tomorrow and complete all my work pending for sportech marketing, bsp, onAir.

             And And And, I casually told my mother that my phone's battery is draining so fast these days. I should buy
             a new one in a month or two. She asked to browse and keep one and send it to papa. Papa told to book it
             for my birthday which is on 16th. I literally freaked out. THEY ARE THE BEST. So I'm getting a new phone
             as soon as I submit my mess fee. I am planning to buy Poco F1 most probably.

            Ankit to submit it. Was supposed to edit secy show down tonight in the studio. But Me Varun and Yash
            kept on watching music videos for our next competition. We are paired with Nilgiri for that. SAD. because
            Nilgiri will do nothing, i know. We asked him to pair us with Kailash, because Zanskar has already
            occupied Himadri -_- Harsh and Lochan are going to sportech trek. Animesh is going home. Harit And
            Deepanshu will also go home (delhites you know). I don't know how will I spend a 3 day long weekend with
            Ankit lol. Also how will I celebrate my birthday :(. Submitted my mess fee online today, so now I can't make a
            online payment today, because bank limit of 25k has exceeded for today. Probably I should sleep now, it's
            4:30 AM and I have a class at 9:30 AM. And most probably I'll order my new phone tomorrow Yay!, second phone
            of my life :)

           I had loads of work to do and also mummy ne ek bar me mana kr diya soo. Actually my parents
           never allow me to go on any trip, they care way too much. 
           Last time, I told them that it's a compulsory NSS trip and went for Valley of the Flowers trek with
           Chirag and Animesh. <br>
           We were aware of the weather conditions, but didn't know that their will be live landslides in front of 
           us. Yes, Live Landslidess, on the last second day, when we reached the peak of the Valley of Flowers
           , rain and light storm started. We thought it will pause soon, but it didn't. Right from their to 
           Roorkee, it didn't. Chirag was insisting to climb even the sacred pilgrimage place above us (i forgot the
           name). But I firmly declined and took the decision to go down because it had started raining. That was the
           best decision I took i suppose. Because that trek was more steep and snowy. We didn't even had shoes with
           good grip, but chirag ko adventure chahiye tha. While coming down, landslides started happening. We successfully
           crossed two, thanks to punjabi people there and their turbans of course. On the second landslide, i slipped 
           and if,I ,by mistake had left the turban out of my hand, I wouldn't be here sitting and typing my blog.
           Everything was wet. We trekked around 14 km down in 3 hours, all wet, jumping landslides and fighting with luck.
           Their was once a waterfall, and no one to help, all three of us, held our hands and slowly walked through a
           FUCKING RUNNING WATERFALL, like I could feel the water about to carry me away, even now, in the deep valleys belows.
           We survived somehow, and now I'm too afraid to go on a trek after that incident. <br>
           So I won't go on any trek now, also it's my birthday on Sunday and my new phone is coming, so a big no.
           Gave suryansh, gauransh and aryan party at night mess today, I don't know why. Also suryansh is sitting
           in my room from 11 pm and he's not leaving. We are just wasting our time lol, but chill hai, it's a 3 days 
           long weekend after all. Oh shit, jyada lamba ho gya aaj ka, bye-bye.

              It's valentine's day today lol. I woke up at 2 pm (as usual :p), made some posts, did my assignment a 
              bit. Interacted with no one today, like literally no one. Was in my room the whole day and listening to
              music. Also Also I ordered my new phone today, POCO F1 it is, it should come on Sunday i guess.

              Chand and Chirag apparently made few beautiful arrangements for my birthday at Red Square.
              Like they brought wooden logs to take my GPL :(. The cake was tasty, it's all over my body now.
              Had to shampoo my hair thrice to take out all the cake from it. <b>THANK YOU so muchhh guys for your wishes
              </b>and please GPL mat liya kro. Aryan and Gauransh know lot of secrets about me now, thanks to KP and Chand
              -_- , Also varun told that I'm the most machaxx guy he's met after coming to IIT. Was a great compliment
              for me *wipes tears* , actually he's also the most machaxx guy I've met after coming to IIT.
              Also too many people are reading my blog these days. I'm a SELEBREETYY now yaaay.

              Apparently Alt+3 brings up heart emoji, learnt that today. Also got my new phone delivered this 
              morning. The phone is nice. Went to see street play performance of Udaigiri then, it was my first
              street experience, they did very well. But the judge was biased, according to news I am hearing
              and hence Udaigiri did not win anything. The version 1 of my birthday party happened today
              after lot of planning at Diggin -_-. I was thinking of giving it at Pirates of the Grill, but 
              Animesh insisted that there's Italian food, and it's nice and bla bla bla. It was the worst food
              I've had recently -_-. The next birthday will come next year and the 3 days long weekend is also
              over :((. I am trying to develop a database for my blog. It's too boring updating the html files
              daily. You'll soon see new elements in my blog. <p>

              The classes started today. We had a very fun lab of transportation at SDA Overbridge. We had to
              find out the speeds of the vehicles crossing by. Also, today I was going to give my second 
              birthday party, but Anushka Di fell sick due to food poisoning, and Harsh left for the hospital. So, I cancelled today's 
              party. We'll have it some other day probably. Nothing much happened today.

            I was free the whole day, like it was Sunday. I did not wake up early enough to attend my classes and
            also we had no laboratory today for soil. I thought I'd get the bonafide certificate for my
            internship signed but UG Section won't do it anyways untill I've visited them 10 times -_-. 
            Missed the dinner, because I was too much involved in my assignment that I forgot when the clock went 
            from 6 pm to 10 pm. The time is 5:04 AM now as I am writing this and hopefully I'll wake up at 7:30,
            do the classes from 8-10 and then sleep again.

          I woke up straight at 1 pm. Someone please wake me up, so that I can go to the classes, though they are boring af!
          I don't know, I put an alarm, but either it doesn't ring, or I am in so deep sleep that I don't notice it ringing.
          Harsh's still in the hospital. Her condition is not too good, according to him. May she recover soon. I again did
          not do anything today, except the percolation problem. I have to complete my lab manual by today and also prepare
          for the viva tomorrow.

          Went all the classes today. Today, I, by mistake reminded the professor, that Saturday is working day
          as Thursday, he didn't know :p. Then I went to OC's meeting of Sportech, twas was a fun experience attending
          meetings of Overall co-ordinators lol. Apparently informals people are giving too much bt in posters, so I sorted
          them myself. <i>Please don't join creative team of any fest, please. </i> I guess, I unknowingly scolded Lochan
          too, since he didn't tell me their exact requirements beforehand. A bad day overall.

          <h2 class="blog-heading">26th February 2020, Friday</h2>
            <p class="blog-content"> 
               Okay, so last few days have been very very very very hectic. <b>I had no time to update the blog, so I am
                 writing the summary of past ek week here.
               </b>
               I completed loads of designs for sportech, helped Saksham in his Microsoft assignment,
               completed Secy Showdown anyhow. 

               Secy Showdown was such a mess, first I messed up the audio, then they the memes, oh god! and then
               the sudden unsync and then the improper titles and then the unusual render file. I was about to
               delete all the files and sleep, it was such a mess.

               And then Saksham's assignment, the deadline got extended twice. We made 3 complete night outs in total.
               Let's hope he gets an internship, and then I'll also try for Microsoft next year hopefully, if I take
               design, I just went one class this week abhi tak. Last Saturday was also working. Sunday kab aaya pata hi nhi
               chla. I finally came to my room tonight after ages. Chelsea lost 3-0 against Bayern yesterday.

               I am not participating in Gazetelle because our super lit lit rep is too busy to write a few articles
               for our magazine. I cannot participate in Gazetelle since last two years because of him. He has time
               to conduct socials, drink whole night, but can't write a article for a magazine. BEST LIT REP EVER.
               Also, everyone is accusing me for Udaigiri_internals insta page, idk why. nvm though. Loman Cheena
               is a hit.

              Submitted all the required documents for my Japan internship. Also forex results came, as expected,
              kuch bhi ho rha tha result me.

              Also Also, I am the course topper in DSL810, like literally, I am the course topper till minor 1.
              In a class jisme Animesh Sir, Saksham Sir and i don't know who else are present, I am the class
              topper. This is the first instance after coming to IIT that I can actually share my grades with
              my family. I hope they don't read my blog. Also Katyayny messaged me on Insta tonight, she reads 
              my blog. I was in shock for a few seconds after listening this.
